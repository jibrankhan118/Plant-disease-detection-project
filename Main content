🌱 Plant Disease Detection using CNN

This repository is about building an Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Python to predict Plant Diseases from leaf images.

It is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that includes:

✅ Model training on Kaggle PlantVillage Dataset

✅ Building a Flask-based Web Application

✅ Predicting Plant Diseases by uploading an image

✅ Clean and modern UI for user interaction
